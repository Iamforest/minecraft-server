# minecraft-server

This is a little project where I wanted to have a Minecraft server hosted on a cloud container that I could turn on and turn off when not using. 
I chose Azure as that is the platform I have the most experience with. I tried to work in the CLI as much as possible and I used terraform to deploy the cloud resources as that is a technology I want to learn.
