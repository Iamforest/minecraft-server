# minecraft-server

This is a little project where I wanted to have a Minecraft server hosted on a cloud container that I could turn on and turn off when not using. 
I chose Azure as that is the platform I have the most experience with. I tried to work in the CLI as much as possible and I used terraform to deploy the cloud resources as that is a technology I want to learn.

## Why the Cloud? Why not use an old laptop or something?
There are 3 reasons I used the cloud:
1. Availability
- I do not play minecraft with friends all that often. So I did not want to worry about keeping a local machine running all the time just for the few times I will boot the server up.
2. Performance 
- My Computer is not the most powerful gaming machine anymore, and my RAM is some of the weakest parts of my machine. I do not have a good time hosting a server and playing at the same time.
3. Network limitations
- The network I am on is not the most consistaint or well constructed. It uses a hybrid modem/router, and while the speeds are fine, for the most part, the consistantcy of the network while playing games is quite obvious.
  Unfortunetly I am not in charge of how the network is setup. If I was, maybe I would not have this point.
